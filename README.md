# GAN Image Dataset

This repository contains the "All GAN Data" dataset, which is a collection of around 262,000 fake and real images. The dataset is sourced from various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X, and others. It is intended for training and evaluating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the field of image generation.

## Dataset Overview

- **Size:** Approximately 12GB
- **Contents:** The dataset includes images categorized for training, validation, and testing purposes.
- **Source:** The data is open source and available on Kaggle.
- **Format:** Images are provided in various common formats such as JPEG, PNG, etc.

## Proposed Methodology

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating realistic images by learning from real-world image data. However, the quality of images generated by GANs may vary depending on several factors, including the source and quality of the training data. 

### Key Points:

1. **Image Source**: GANs are trained on images obtained from social media platforms where users often upload images captured with smartphones. These images may lack fine details and suffer from quality degradation upon uploading.

2. **Quality Variations**: While GANs can generate realistic images, not all parts of the generated images may be equally convincing. For instance, facial features like eyes tend to have more distinct patterns compared to other features like hair, chins, and ears, making them easier to replicate realistically.

3. **Limitations**: Despite advancements in GAN technology, there may still be noticeable discrepancies in specific features of the generated images, such as the eyes, which may not match the level of realism achieved in other parts of the image.
